                          At Kindertown, we strongly believe in fundamental
                          privacy rights - and we believe these rights should
                          not vary depending on your location in the world.
                          That's why we consider any data related to Kindertown
                          as "personal data," regardless of where individuals
                          reside. This means that data directly identifying you
                          - such as your name - is personal data, as well as
                          data that may not directly identify you but can
                          reasonably be used to do so, such as your device's
                          serial number. Aggregated data is considered
                          non-personal data under this Privacy Policy.

                          our website or through Kindertown applications (such

                          and delete your personal data. We have provided these
                          rights to all our customers, and if you choose to
                          exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not
                          to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a

                          personal data by us, you have the right to withdraw

                          you must sign in to your Kindertown account and

                          In some cases, we may not be able to fulfill your
                          request - for example, if you ask us to delete your
                          transaction data and Kindertown is legally obligated
                          to retain that transaction record to comply with the
                          law. We may also decline to fulfill a request if doing
                          so would undermine our legitimate use of data for
                          anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you
                          request deletion of an account under investigation for
                          security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request
                          may be denied include if it jeopardizes the privacy of
                          others, is frivolous or malicious, or would be
                          extremely impractical. If you are unable to access

                          built on a strong foundation of security. We employ
                          administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
                          protect your personal data, taking into account the
                          nature of the data, how it is processed, and the
                          potential threats. We continuously strive to enhance
                          these protective measures to help ensure the security
                          of your personal data.

                          Kindertown understands the importance of safeguarding
                          the personal data of children, which we consider to be
                          individuals under the age of 13 or the equivalent age
                          as specified by law. Therefore, Kindertown has
                          implemented additional processes and protections to
                          help keep children's personal data safe. To access
                          certain Kindertown services, children must obtain
                          parental consent. Children's accounts can be created
                          by parents or, in managed situations, by the
                          educational institutions where the children are
                          enrolled.

                              To create a parent and child account, parents must
                              submit the Family Privacy Disclosure for Children,
                              which describes how Kindertown handles children's
                              personal data - for example, as part of school
                              enrollment procedures.

                              Educational institutions using the Kindertown
                              system for school management can also create new
                              accounts for student parents. These schools are
                              required to obtain parental consent. If we find
                              that a child's personal data was used by the
                              school or its employees without appropriate
                              authorization or in violation of the law, we will

                              the relevant legal authorities in the country.

                          In other instances, we may require additional
                          information or inform you that more time is needed to

                          improvement in how we handle privacy matters, we will
                          take steps to address them at the earliest
                          opportunity. We will strive to provide you with
                          relevant information applicable to your situation. In
                          the event of significant changes to this Privacy
